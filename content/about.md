üëãüèΩ Hello, and welcome to my website! I'm Pramana.

For the details of this site: I use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with a modified [Archie theme](https://github.com/athul/archie). This site is deployed through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
I'm always changing my mind on this blog's design, so don't be surprised if there are changes here and there.

<!-- I have _no_ commitment to a single subject for this blog. However, I do plan on keeping most posts **math and computer science** related. -->

While I'm not set on a single section of math, I love using new discoveries in math and creating pictures. You can fairly accurately measure how excited I am to make a new post by how many photos are in it.

If you want to reach out, you can contact me on my [Mathstodon](https://mathstodon.xyz/@pramana).
