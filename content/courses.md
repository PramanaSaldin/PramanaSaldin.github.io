Some thoughts on all of my courses. Inspired by [this](https://ruipan.xyz/wisc_courses.html).

{{< figure src="/img/ANTHRO105.jpg" height="250px" title="ANTHRO 105: Principles of biological anthropology" caption="Easy course, no exams, easy lab once a week too. Would recommend for people not interested in bio but need a credit.">}}

{{< figure src="/img/MATH475.png" height="250px" title="MATH 475: Introduction to combinatorics" caption="Very tedious course. I would recommend knowing how to do basic coding so you can verify with a computer that your answer is right. Also [the wolfram](https://www.wolframalpha.com/) is useful. Overall though, the course is easy, especially for people well versed in competition math/programming.">}}
