  - **Abstract.** This is an expository paper on the prerequisites for Gårding’s inequality.
    Proposed by Lars Gårding, this inequality has applications in the
    study of weak solutions to elliptic partial differential equations.
    We will give the prerequisites to
    state Gårding’s inequality and give one application.
