I plan on introducing our project and go over some topics in geometric group theory I haven&amp;rsquo;t covered before.
If you want to skip the mathematical jargon and see the results, skip to the end.
Hyperbolic geometry Hyperbolic geometry is an important part of non-Euclidean geometry, where we study spaces that do not satisfy the postulates of Euclidean geometry.</description></item><item><title>Graph ends and their purpose in geometric group theory</title><link>https://pr4-kp.github.io/posts/graphgroupends/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pr4-kp.github.io/posts/graphgroupends/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ll give an intuition for how mathematicians define what graph ends are, and explain their use in geometric group theory. However, before I can do that, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain what ends are in a graph theory perspective.
What are ends? The word ends is a little confusing, because they don&amp;rsquo;t really represent the &amp;ldquo;end&amp;rdquo; of a graph, at least not how we would define an end in real life. Think of a rope.</description></item></channel></rss>
