I plan on introducing our project and go over some topics in geometric group theory I haven&amp;rsquo;t covered before. This project was joint work with Noah Jillson and Katerina Stuopis with our advisors Daniel Levitin and Tullia Dymarz.
If you want to skip the mathematical jargon and see the results, skip to the end.</description></item><item><title>Graph ends and their purpose in geometric group theory</title><link>https://pr4-kp.github.io/posts/graphgroupends/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pr4-kp.github.io/posts/graphgroupends/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ll give an intuition for how mathematicians define what graph ends are, and explain their use in geometric group theory. However, before I can do that, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain what ends are in a graph theory perspective.
What are ends? The word ends is a little confusing, because they don&amp;rsquo;t really represent the &amp;ldquo;end&amp;rdquo; of a graph, at least not how we would define an end in real life. Think of a rope.</description></item></channel></rss>
