As a result, I&amp;rsquo;ve primarily seen machine learning used when the function we are trying to estimate is assumed to be continuous (or differentiable, smooth, etc.), because then you can use nice results from analysis to prove convergence. But algebraic structures like groups can be discrete objects, where there is no way to smoothly interpolate between two group elements.</description></item><item><title>Why homology is weaker than homotopy</title><link>https://pr4-kp.github.io/posts/same-homology-different-homotopy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pr4-kp.github.io/posts/same-homology-different-homotopy/</guid><description>The main two flavors of invariants in an introductory algebraic topology class are the homology groups associated with a space and the homotopy groups (typically just the first homotopy group, $\pi_1$). The fundamental group is formed by looking at loops starting at a certain point. Similarly, the homotopy groups look at cycles, which can be thought of as loops that commute. Because of these similarities, I wondered about which one was &amp;ldquo;better&amp;rdquo; at differentiating topological spaces.</description></item><item><title>Understanding exact sequences</title><link>https://pr4-kp.github.io/posts/exact-sequence/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pr4-kp.github.io/posts/exact-sequence/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a motivating question I had from group theory: if $N \trianglelefteq G$ is a normal subgroup, is it necessarily true that $G\cong G/N\times N$? Looking at non-abelian groups quickly shows that the answer is no (take the dihedral group $D_3=\langle r,t \mid r^3=t^2=1, rt=tr^{-1}\rangle$ and the normal subgroup $\langle r\rangle\cong \mathbb{Z}/3$).
I later learned about semidirect products $\rtimes_\phi$, which generalize the direct product $\times$. But even this was insufficient to describe group decompositions.</description></item><item><title>My first CTF: HackMIT 2023's puzzle</title><link>https://pr4-kp.github.io/posts/hackmit-solutions-2023/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pr4-kp.github.io/posts/hackmit-solutions-2023/</guid><description>On July 4th, MIT emailed all applicants to their hackathon, HackMIT, that they have started a puzzle, where the top 50 competitors would be granted admission into HackMIT.
Taking their advice, I went to checking the website. In the FAQ section, I noticed something new:
What does it mean?
The strange placement of upper/lowercase letters and the length of all words being the same made me think some message was being hidden here in binary.</description></item><item><title>Visualizing prime spectrums with graphs</title><link>https://pr4-kp.github.io/posts/visualizing-prime-spectrum/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pr4-kp.github.io/posts/visualizing-prime-spectrum/</guid><description>In Atiyah and Macdonald&amp;rsquo;s book we construct a certain topological space from a ring called the prime spectrum of a ring. While working through the exercises, I saw an interesting way of viewing closed and open subsets of the prime spectrum that borrowed ideals from combinatorics.
What is the prime spectrum of a ring? Definition (Prime ideal). An ideal $\mathfrak{a}$ of a ring $A$ is a subring (a subset of $A$ that is still a ring under $A$&amp;rsquo;s operations) that has the property that any $a\in A$ times $p\in \mathfrak{a}$ has $ap\in \mathfrak{a}$ as well.</description></item><item><title>Visualizing horospheres on hyperbolic groups</title><link>https://pr4-kp.github.io/posts/horospheres-project/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pr4-kp.github.io/posts/horospheres-project/</guid><description>This semester I was able to participate in our undergradute research lab, and, relevant to my past work, our project was in the field of geometric group theory. I plan on introducing our project and go over some topics in geometric group theory I haven&amp;rsquo;t covered before. This project was joint work with Noah Jillson and Katerina Stuopis with our advisors Daniel Levitin and Tullia Dymarz.
If you want to skip the mathematical jargon and see the results, skip to the end.</description></item><item><title>Weak solutions to dirichlet boundary problems</title><link>https://pr4-kp.github.io/posts/dirichlet-boundary-problems-weak/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pr4-kp.github.io/posts/dirichlet-boundary-problems-weak/</guid><description>For the final project in Analysis I, my professor asked us to write a paper on a topic adjacent to analysis. Being an applied mathematician, he recommended I study a very specific inequality called Gårding’s inequality.
If you would like to learn more about Gårding’s inequality itself, my paper has all the details about it, the prerequisites to understand it, and an application. In fact, most of the paper covers the necessary material needed to understand what the inequality is even saying (PDE analysis seems to be a lot less abstract than other fields, considering all the machinery I needed).</description></item><item><title>Group structures</title><link>https://pr4-kp.github.io/posts/group-structures/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pr4-kp.github.io/posts/group-structures/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on Beachy and Blair&amp;rsquo;s Abstract Algebra Book, specifically their chapter on Group structure (7), and I wanted to summarize what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned about group structures.
Finite groups and structure The problems and results derived from this chapter almost all concern with finite groups. We know a lot about finite groups. For example, we have this result:
Theorem (Burnside, 1904). Every group of order $p^a q^b$, where $p$ and $q$ are (not necessarily distinct) primes is solvable.</description></item><item><title>Graph ends and their purpose in geometric group theory</title><link>https://pr4-kp.github.io/posts/graphgroupends/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pr4-kp.github.io/posts/graphgroupends/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ll give an intuition for how mathematicians define what graph ends are, and explain their use in geometric group theory. However, before I can do that, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain what ends are in a graph theory perspective.
What are ends? The word ends is a little confusing, because they don&amp;rsquo;t really represent the &amp;ldquo;end&amp;rdquo; of a graph, at least not how we would define an end in real life. Think of a rope.</description></item></channel></rss>
