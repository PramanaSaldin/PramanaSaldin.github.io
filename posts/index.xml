Finite groups and structure The problems and results derived from this chapter almost all concern with finite groups. We know a lot about finite groups. For example, we have this result:
Theorem (Burnside, 1904). Every group of order $p^a q^b$, where $p$ and $q$ are (not necessarily distinct) primes is solvable.</description></item><item><title>graph ends and their purpose in geometric group theory</title><link>https://pr4-kp.github.io/posts/graphgroupends/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pr4-kp.github.io/posts/graphgroupends/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ll give an intuition for how mathematicians define what graph ends are, and explain their use in geometric group theory. However, before I can do that, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain what ends are in a graph theory perspective.
What are ends? The word ends is a little confusing, because they don&amp;rsquo;t really represent the &amp;ldquo;end&amp;rdquo; of a graph, at least not how we would define an end in real life. Think of a rope.</description></item></channel></rss>
