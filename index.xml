Inspired by this.
ANTHRO 105: Principles of biological anthropologyEasy course, no exams, easy lab once a week too. Would recommend for people not interested in bio but need a credit.
MATH 475: Introduction to combinatoricsVery tedious course. I would recommend knowing how to do basic coding so you can verify with a computer that your answer is right. Also the wolfram is useful. Overall though, the course is easy, especially for people well versed in competition math/programming.</description></item><item><title>notes</title><link>https://PramanaSaldin.github.io/notes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://PramanaSaldin.github.io/notes/</guid><description>This is my compilation of notes for my college classes.
MATH 521: Analysis I Notes (PDF)(TeX) Final Paper – Gårding&amp;rsquo;s Inequality (PDF)(TeX) Abstract. This is an expository paper on the prerequisites for Gårding’s inequality. Proposed by Lars Gårding, this inequality has applications in the study of weak solutions to elliptic partial differential equations. We will give the prerequisites to state Gårding’s inequality and give one application.

Finite groups and structure The problems and results derived from this chapter almost all concern with finite groups. We know a lot about finite groups. For example, we have this result:
Theorem (Burnside, 1904). Every group of order $p^a q^b$, where $p$ and $q$ are (not necessarily distinct) primes is solvable.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://PramanaSaldin.github.io/archives/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://PramanaSaldin.github.io/archives/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
